# BullCowGame
C++ Project I worked on in a Udemy Game Development Course. 

This project is a simple terminal game based off the classic and paper and pencil game called Bulls and Cows. I was able to edit the game world to create a 
small pier and hill area. I was able to utilize the assets to create new forests and lighting, and roads and a lot of really fun stuff. I programmed the entire
project in VS Code using C++. This was a super fun project and I am excited to dive in deeper to see what Unreal Ungine has to offer more.
